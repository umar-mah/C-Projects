Project 1 is the Balloon Tracking Surveillance Program.
  This program creates a large map. 
  Based on the map, a balloon will be hidden somewhere in the map. 
  The user will then guess coordinates for where the balloon exists. If the user is not successful in guessing where the balloon is, the application will indicate       which direction the balloon is (north, south, east, or west).

Project 2 is the Potion Craft Game.
  Potion Craft is an alchemist simulator where you mix ingredients to brew potions. There are several ways you can gather the required ingredients for a potion. You     might go out into nature and search for some plants. After searching for some natural ingredients, maybe you will grind ingredients and carefully mix them in your     cauldron. Heat the coals. Boil and stir. Add the base: water, oil, or… something else. Part of the fun for this type of game is that you will need to experiment to     find new recipes. 
  You start the game after you have just opened your new potions shop. Unfortunately, you don’t start with anything so you will have to go out and forage for             ingredients. As you start to build a stockpile of ingredients, you can try and make more complex potions. Ultimately, you are trying to build the ultimate shop where   someone could buy any natural ingredients, potions, reagents, or legendary products!
